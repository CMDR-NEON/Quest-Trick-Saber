Quest port of https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/TrickSaber.
Follows https://tonimacaroni.github.io/TrickSaber-Docs/Configuration (config at /sdcard/Android/data/com.beatgames.beatsaber/files/mod_cfgs/TrickSaber.json) with a few differences:
1. Her "EnableCuttingDuringTrick" is my "EnableTrickCutting"
2. Her "IsSpeedVelocityDependent" is my "IsSpinVelocityDependent"

Also, there is no UI, pending a good Quest Beatsaber UI library.

Changed drastically from the original Quest port by Rugtveit, so please do not bother him.
