Quest port of https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/TrickSaber.

Follows https://tonimacaroni.github.io/TrickSaber-Docs/Configuration (config at /sdcard/Android/data/com.beatgames.beatsaber/files/mod_cfgs/TrickSaber.json) with a few differences:
1. Her "EnableCuttingDuringTrick" is my "EnableTrickCutting"
2. Her "IsSpeedVelocityDependent" is my "IsSpinVelocityDependent"

Added options:
1. "regenerateConfig": when set to true, the config file will be completely rewritten to have all default values on next config load.
2. "ButtonOneAction": action triggered by A or X.
3. "ButtonTwoAction": action triggered by B or Y.

To change your config, simply drag your editted TrickSaber.json into the BMBF upload box (as you did for the mod zip itself).

Also, there is no UI, pending https://github.com/zoller27osu/Quest-BSML.

Changed drastically from the original Quest port by Rugtveit, so please do not bother him.
